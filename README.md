## Welcome to moa-multiflow’s documentation!

This tutorial will show you how to export Jupyter Notebooks from MOA as well as how to configure the Jupyter Notebooks for running the exported tasks. We expect that you have already Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed on your machine. If
not, please install them before reading further more. This tutorial describes the configuration process on a Windows 10 computer, but it is possibly applied as well for other operating systems without much modifications.

Jupyter Notebooks nowadays can run the code written in various programming languages by connecting to the corresponding kernels. MOA use Java language, so that we need to install a Jupyter kernel for Java called IJava. You can download and
install the latest version of IJava from a Github repository [here](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava).

## Export tasks from MOA


Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/truongtd6285/moa-multiflow/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
